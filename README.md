<h1 align="center" dir="auto">Website Test</h1>
<p> The main objective of this project is to show a model of website/social media using Python, HTML and CSS although there's
no CSS on the code</p>

<h2>How does it works?</h2>
<p>Although it is a simple project, it is a nice demonstration
how python could work in websites instead of JavaScript.</p>

<p>There's three principal pages on this website:</p>
<p>- Homepage <br> - Contatos <br> - Usuario</p>

<h2>Homepage</h2>
<p>At the homepage the URL is formed by the principal website URL,
without thoses "/"<br> Exemple:
</p>
<img src="images/homepageLink">
